# Thesis

### Thesis is a CMS that integrates as seamlessly as possible into your current website.

Most Rails content management systems make you conform to their system from the start, 
making it difficult to just "drop in" the gem and make it work with your CMS. Thesis
tries to be a drop-in CMS that doesn't hijack your development workflow.
